      <p class="para_1">I have started a course that focuses on coding. The course has just start and i've already made alot of progress.
        I've learned programming languages <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, which is used in <b>Web Development.</b>
        This has been a good learning curve because you are forced to work on your own and that teaches you to be
        independent, but also you are encouraged to ask people for help if needed. People ask you questions too
        and when you answer, it helps you to understand better.</p>
