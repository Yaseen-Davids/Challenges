        <h2>About :</h2>
        <p>I am a very hardworking and ambitious person with a passion for working with Computers and People. I’ve been building
          computers since i was 9 years old, and only recently i’ve gotten into the software side of computers. I’ve started
          developing a game using python, and i have created multiple scripts using python that i use on a daily basis. I
          am a very curious person and i believe that my curiosity is what makes me keep moving forward, opening new doors,
          and doing new things.</p>
